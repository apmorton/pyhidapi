# Installing pyhidapi
pyhidapi is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hid/) and can be installed using pip.
```
pip install hid
```

pyhidapi is dependant upon the [hidapi library](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi), which must be installed separately.

# Installing hidapi

Installation procedures vary depending on your distribution.

Binary distributions are available in the community repository.

```
2. Install hidapi

pacman -Sy hidapi
```

### CentOS/RHEL

### Others
Binary distributions may be available in your package repositories. If not, you can build from source as described [in the libusb/hidapi README](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi#build-instructions).

## Windows
Installation procedure for Windows is described [in the libusb/hidapi README](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi#building-on-windows)

Binary distributions are provided by [libusb/hidapi](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases)

## OSX
There are currently no official binary distributions for Mac, so you must build hidapi yourself.

Installation instructions are described [in the libusb/hidapi README](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi#mac)

You can also use brew:
```
brew install hidapi
```
It should be noted that at this time, brew still uses the old signal11 repository which has long since been abandond.
See [Homebrew/homebrew-core#41122](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/41122).
